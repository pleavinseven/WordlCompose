## General info
This is a Wordle clone for Android that is written in Kotlin and built using Jetpack Compose UI kit. The game allows users to guess a hidden word with a limited number of attempts.

The project utilizes Kotlin coroutines to call Dictionaryapi.dev and check for the existence of guessed words. Additionally, a Room database is used to store the correct answers locally on the device.

The project adheres to the MVVM architecture to ensure a clear separation of concerns between the user interface, game logic, and data storage.

To get started with the game, simply download the project and build it using Android Studio. Enjoy playing WordlCompose!
